This distressing and persistent sense of tiredness or exhaustion affects patients’ activities of daily living and reduces their quality of life. Fortunately, there are many things that can be done to reduce CRF and improve patients’ general well-being. This modular learning program developed by a panel of experts from across Canada outlines a multidisciplinary management approach for CRF. The overview reviews what CRF is, how to assess CRF, and how to treat CRF. Additional learning activities are available to delve deeper into the various interventions known to help improve CRF, including physical activity, psychological well-being, sleep, spirituality, and nutrition. Supplemental patient materials are also available to help discuss treatment options with your patients and help them create personalized action plans to manage their fatigue and help them feel better.</p><p id="audience">This educational activity is intended for oncologists, oncology nurses, primary care physicians, psychologists, spiritual health practitioners, physiotherapists, kinesiologists, dietitians, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals involved in the care of patients with cancer.</p><p id="learning-objectives">This educational activity is intended for oncologists, oncology nurses, primary care physicians, psychologists, spiritual health practitioners, physiotherapists, kinesiologists, dietitians, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals involved in the care of patients with cancer.</p></div>
